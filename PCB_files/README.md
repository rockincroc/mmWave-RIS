This contents of this folder were used for the ACM MobiHoc 2025 paper "[Practical Design and Orchestration of Frequency-Shifting RIS for NLoS mmWave Sensing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704413.3764440)".

This folder contains the PCB schematic, pick-and-place file, and all intelligent data needed to fabricate and assemble a 1-bit RIS operating in the n260 band (37 to 40 GHz). 

The diodes in use are [MADP-000907-14020x](https://cdn.macom.com/datasheets/MADP-000907-14020x.pdf) from MACOM.
